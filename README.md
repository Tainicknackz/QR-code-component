## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile responsive


### What I learned

I learnt how I use combination of CSS properties effectively to center image within its container, resize it to the desired dimensions, and add a rounded border for a polished appearance.

```css
container img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 200px;
  height: 210px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Advanced CSS Techniques: Continue exploring advanced CSS properties and techniques, like CSS Grid and Flexbox, to create more complex layouts and improve responsiveness.

Responsive Design: Refine skills in responsive design to ensure that the QR code component adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

Accessibility: Pay attention to accessibility best practices to ensure that the QR code component is usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

JavaScript Integration: Experiment with integrating JavaScript to add interactive elements to the QR code component, such as dynamic content or animations.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Work on improving cross-browser compatibility to ensure that the QR code component displays and functions correctly in different web browsers.

Code Optimization: Focus on optimizing the code for performance, ensuring that the QR code component loads quickly and efficiently.


### Useful resources
